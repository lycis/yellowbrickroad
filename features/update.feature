Feature: Update local project
  As developer I can update my local project with packages from a server so I do
  not have to handle dependencies on my own.

Background:
  Given the remote server is a mock of a complete simple server
  
Scenario: No config file is available
  Given there is no config file
  When I update the project
  Then the error "no configuration available" is displayed

Scenario: Update project in current directory
  Given the file "ybr.yml" contains
    """
    !ybr-client-configuration
    packages: 
    - .org.junit
    serverAddress: mockedserver:80
    targetPath: .
    """
  When I update the project
  Then no error is displayed
  Then there is a file named "junit.txt"

Scenario: Update project with differing target directory
  Given the file "ybr.yml" contains
    """
    !ybr-client-configuration
    packages: 
    - .org.junit
    serverAddress: mockedserver:80
    targetPath: lib/
    """
  And a directory called "lib" was created
  When I update the project
  Then there is a file named "lib/junit.txt"

Scenario: Update project and automatically create target directory
  Given the file "ybr.yml" contains
    """
    !ybr-client-configuration
    packages: 
    - .org.junit
    serverAddress: mockedserver:80
    targetPath: lib/mylibs
    """
  And temporary filesystem cleanup was disabled
  When I update the project with "-ct"
  Then no error is displayed
  Then there is a file named "lib/mylibs/junit.txt"

Scenario: Update project while the target directory does not exist
  Given the file "ybr.yml" contains
    """
    !ybr-client-configuration
    packages: 
    - .org.junit
    serverAddress: mockedserver:80
    targetPath: doesnotexist/
    """

  When I update the project
  Then the error "target directory does not exist (use --create-target for automatic creation)" is displayed
